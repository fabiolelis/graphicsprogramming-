"You have just started working for a games company called GaCo, and as your first task you have been asked to create a small addictive 2D game using HTML5 and JavaScript. The game will, for the time being, be focused only on players accessing the game through their desktop browser. GaCo hopes the game will become popular, so that they can then sell advertisements on the webpage where the game is available."
